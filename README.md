# Easy Backup

The aim of this app is, given two folders in your computer (or external hardrive), `origin` and `destination`, be able to detect the differences between the two folders and set `destination` to the same state as `origin`. The code only copies and deletes the newly added or deleted files in `origin`, therefore it is much more efficient than manually overwritting the entire `destination` folder, and that is the main point of the app.

## How to use it?


## Motivation of the project

I created this code to automate the backups in my computer. I keep all my important files in a "origin" folder in my computer, and I periodically copy this folder into a hard drive "destination" folder. The code is a simple yet efficent solution, that does what I want without any extra features I do not need.
